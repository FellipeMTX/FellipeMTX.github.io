## Welcome to my Portfolio

### Biografy

My name is Fellipe De Sousa Montes, known on the internet as ''FellipeMTX''. I have always been passionate about technology and, mainly, computers. Since I finished elementary school, I have been looking for an academic education that would suit my interests. I have attended colleges such as veterinary medicine, journalism, and, more recently, law. Courses that, although I enjoyed, were not what I really wanted for my life. It was then that I discovered life as a programmer. Since then, I have been going deeper and deeper and falling in love with it more and more each day. on this page you can get to know a little more about the practice of my new passion and, maybe, help me improve. i hope you enjoy it and give me feedback, I am always open to suggestions.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/FellipeMTX/FellipeMTX.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
